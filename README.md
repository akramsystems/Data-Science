# Data-Science

Here I created a simple program using Python that used the concept of Decision Trees to train
a data set of body metrics (Weight, Height, Shoe Size) with given Genders of Male or Female.
After Training the data set I then inserted body metrics and predicted the gender based on my trained
dataset.
